# Apriori, a Frequent Pattern Analysis algorithm

Market Basket Analysis is a technique which identifies the strength of association between pairs of products purchased together and identify patterns of co-occurrence. 
A co-occurrence is when two or more things take place together.

Association rule mining finds interesting associations and relationships among large sets of data items. 
This rule shows how frequently an itemset occurs in a transaction. A typical example is Market Based Analysis.

What is Apriori Algorithm?
  1. It is an algorithm for frequent itemset mining and association rule learning over transactional databases algorithm for mining frequent itemsets for boolean association
rules.

  2. It proceeds by identifying the frequent individual items in the database and extending them to larger and larger item sets as long as those itemsets appear sufficiently often in
the database.

  3. The frequent itemsets determined by Apriori can be used to determine association rules which highlight general trends in the database: this has applications in domains such as
market basket analysis .
